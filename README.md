# Superpixel + token merging 
## Objective: 
Reduce the speed from reduce computational cost from redundant pixel.

##  Superpixel 
- superpixel 
- non-superpixel 


## Token merging (timm)
- 

## Token merging (dino) 


## Transformer Module (long)
# ablation study 
- multi-layer of superpixel 
## Note: 
- [?] how to recognize pixels that are not useful in prediction?
